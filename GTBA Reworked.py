"""
this is a rework of the Generic Text Based RPG, using what ive learned
to improve on the original design and make a much better experience
for players, teachers and the designer alike, Enjoy!
Thanks to our playtesters and educators:
Peyton(playtester)
Bella as the slime (weirdo slime/playtester)
John "The Princess" Lastname (playtester)
Ryan "Goliath" Lastname (Helped me with f strings and features)
Tori "The Aunt" Lastname (Playtester)
Mr. Earl, my intro to computing teacher (Taught me most of the stuff)
Teacher Chang (taught me classes and told me to look into dictionaries)
Alex(playtester)
THIS IS A PROJECT MADE SOLEY BY YURI, ANYONE WHO SAYS OTHERWISE IS A STINKY LIAR
